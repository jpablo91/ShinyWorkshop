[**Pablo Gomez**](http://www.spablo-temporal.network) (DVM, MPVM, PhD) is a post-doctoral researcher at the [Center for Animal Disease Modeling and Surveillance (CADMS)](https://cadms.vetmed.ucdavis.edu). His research interest includes spatio-temporal modeling of infectious diseases and data visualization. Pablo works with methods for analysis and modeling of complex systems (i.e. network theory and agent based models) to evaluate the risk of introduction of diseases, disease spread and strategies to control/prevent outbreaks. Some of his modeling work has been used for evaluate control strategies for COVID-19 outbreaks in nursing homes, Introduction of African swine fever in North Macedonia and Foot-and-mouth disease surveillance strategies in Ecuador. Pablo is also an advocate of open access frameworks and during his free time he enjoys making music and visuals.
