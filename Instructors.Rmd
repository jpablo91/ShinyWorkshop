[**Pablo Gomez**](http://www.spablo-temporal.network) (DVM, MPVM, PhD) I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [Center for Animal Disease Modeling and Surveillance (CADMS)](https://cadms.vetmed.ucdavis.edu). My research interest includes spatio-temporal modeling of infectious diseases and data visualization. I like to work with methods for analysis and modeling of complex systems (i.e. network theory and agent based models) applied to evaluate the risk of introduction of diseases, disease spread and strategies to control/prevent outbreaks. Some of my modeling work has been used for evaluate control strategies for COVID-19 outbreaks in nursing homes, Introduction of African swine fever in North Macedonia and Foot-and-mouth disease surveillance strategies in Ecuador. I am also an fan of open access frameworks and during my free time I enjoy making music and visuals.
